### Hi there üëã

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong entrepreneurial mindset, constantly seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and innovate in the field. With experience in developing dynamic web applications using a variety of tools and technologies, including JavaScript, Express.js, Python, React, Redux, HTML, and CSS, Always excited to explore new technologies and different approaches to software development.

### My Story.
From my early days tinkering with the first IBM computer, equipped with the sizable 5.5-inch floppy disk, to assembling my own PC, technology has always been interest in my live. 
The spark of programming ignited during high school with Turbo Pascal, setting the stage for programming. An opportunity arose when I discovered App Academy, providing a gateway to reenter the tech world. The comprehensive full-stack software development program, tailored to real-world professional settings, became my launchpad. Balancing the demands of a full-time job, I dedicated myself to completing the course, demonstrating my unwavering commitment to transitioning into this field. I tackled three full-stack projects, written with languages such as Javascript and Python. Then finally deployed on Render.

### Currently
- üî≠ Dedication to continuous improvement, I consistently am improving my algorithmic problem-solving skills through various platforms. Engaging challenges on platforms such as Code of   
  Advent, LeetCode, Structy, and Hackerrank.
- üëØ In my pursuit of continuous education, I recently completed a comprehensive Java course that placed a strong emphasis on hands-on coding and testing using MVC principles.
      The course delved into the combination of Maven and Spring Boot, providing insights into building robust and scalable applications. With a focus on practical implementation, the side-by-side coding
      and testing approach using Maven allowed me to gain a deep understanding of how MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles in Java development. The integration of Spring Boot added another layer enabling the           creation of dynamic applications.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: My hobbies are photography, go-karts, grilling, trying / building new things.

This project stands was achieved through our collective team effort, guided by the principles of Agile Scrum methodologies to ensure efficiency and success. Powering our backend is Flask, the engine behind API calls, while the authenticated login experience is crafted through the use of Flask Forms modal. We harnessed the collaborative features of GitHub. Each team member contributed by creating dedicated branches for new featuresl Before these features found their way into the main branch, code on new feature branches underwent a thorough review and required approval from at least two individuals. This practice ensured not only the smooth merging of code but also maintained the integrity of our final project.
