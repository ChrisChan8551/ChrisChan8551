### Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong entrepreneurial mindset, constantly seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and innovate in the field. With experience in developing dynamic web applications using a variety of tools and technologies, including JavaScript, Express.js, Python, React, Redux, HTML, and CSS, Always excited to explore new technologies and different approaches to software development.

### My Story.
I've always been into technology since I was young, starting from the first IBM computer with the huge 5.5 inch floppy disk, then progressing to building my own PC. Finally got a taste of programming in high school with Turbo Pascal. From there, an opportunity opened when I found App Academy. It gave me the chance to jump back into the tech world. We learned full stack software development that was tailored to real world professional settings. I completed this course while also working full time, and thus evidence of my dedication to transition to this field. I was able to complete 3 full stack projects using various languages such as Javascript and Python. 

### Currently
- 🔭 I'm always persevering, improving my algorithmic problem-solving skills through platforms like Code of Advent, LeetCode, Structy, and Hackerrank.
- 👯 As continuing education, I also recently completed a Java course that focuses on side by side coding / testing using MVC principals, Mavaen, and Springboot.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My hobbies are photography, go-karts, grilling, trying / building new things.

This project stands was achieved through our collective team effort, guided by the principles of Agile Scrum methodologies to ensure efficiency and success. Powering our backend is Flask, the engine behind API calls, while the authenticated login experience is crafted through the use of Flask Forms modal. We harnessed the collaborative features of GitHub. Each team member contributed by creating dedicated branches for new featuresl Before these features found their way into the main branch, code on new feature branches underwent a thorough review and required approval from at least two individuals. This practice ensured not only the smooth merging of code but also maintained the integrity of our final project.
